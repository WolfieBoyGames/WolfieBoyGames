- 👋 Hey, welcome to my GitHub Page, I’m Joseph and I have endless amounts of ideas for creating games and ADHD so none get finished! (One day hopefully)
- 👀 I love strategy games, Warhammer 40,000 and shopping gmes
- 🌱 I struggle with maths so coding is a difficulty when putting together projects, so outsourcing is my only real option.
- 💞️ I've published 3-4 games publicly to positive reviews on all of them
- 📫 If you want to reach me send me a message on discord "CommissarJoseph"
